Unofficial Gentoo GNOME overlay
-------------------------------

This overlay was designed for **GNOME 3.10** development for Gentoo...

**But goes wild!** (note that I really hope that we helped EVA at least a bit)

**Current status: 3.11.90**

 - stable branch is target **Sabayon 14.01** ( https://github.com/Heather/gentoo-gnome/tree/stable )
 - master branch goes forward 3.11.4 -> ... and works already
 - for `3.10` There is official gnome overlay: http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/gnome.git;a=summary
 - note that quality of this overlay is REALLY BAD (due lazyness)
 - contributors are still welcome.
